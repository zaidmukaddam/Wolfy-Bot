# Wolfy
Discord bot connected to Wolfram Alpha API 

## Usability
By using Wolfy, you will be able to resolve mathematical, calculus and ecuation expressions directly into any Discord text channel on your Discord Server. Here are some examples on what you will be capable of.

* math expression examples: 2+2, 2^3, x^3+2, sin(x)/cos(x)
* equal sized arrays: [1,2,3,4] [2,4,9,16] (this will print square x!)
* sympy equations: 2+x**3+sin(x) (beware to use x as variable)

To call wolfy and send a query use the following format
```bash
   !wolfy <wolfram math expression>
   !wolfyplot <2 arrays of equal size>
   !wolfyplotf <sympy.sympify expressions>
```
